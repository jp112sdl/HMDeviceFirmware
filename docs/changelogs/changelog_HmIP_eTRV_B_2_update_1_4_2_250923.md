Version 1.4.2 - 2025-09-23
--------------------------------------------------------------

** Bugfix
   * Correction for MANU set point temperature update after window open.
      If window open is detected (extern/intern) and during this time the device
      get the command "Eco-Mode", the device updated the set point temperature
      after window close and "Eco-Mode" off to the window open temperature.
   * The device did not report an error after the decalcification run is performed
     without a valve.
   * Unnecessary valve movements with several window contacts.
      If several window contacts are linked to the device, an unwanted valve movement
      occurred from the second window open message.
   * After a reinclusion, the device sometimes only reacts to a window contact after
     deleting and reintegrating.
   * Missing valve was not detected after decalcification run.

** Improvement
   * The automatic switchover from manu-mode to auto-mode after a restart following
     receipt of the first time-info telegram should be deactivated.
