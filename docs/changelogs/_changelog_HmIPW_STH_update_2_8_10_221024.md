Device: HmIPW-STH - Homematic IP Wired Temperature and Humidity Sensor - indoor

Company: eQ-3, Maiburger Str. 29, 26789 Leer, Germany


Version 2.8.010 - 2022-10-10
--------------------------------------------------------------

** Bugfix
   * After reinclusion, partly cyclic data telegrams for eTRV, actuator and FAL are not
     sent.


Version 2.8.002 - 2021-12-08
--------------------------------------------------------------

** Bugfix
   * Device does not respond to ALL_TRIPLE_BURST_LISTENING_DEVICES.
      A generally valid message to the address ALL_TRIPLE_BURST_LISTENING_DEVICES is
      supported now.
   * DRIx window contacts of a room cannot form the necessary AND connection.
      If a window contact with several channels is linked as partner, window-closed was
      already detected if only one channel of the window contact reported window-closed.

** New Feature
   * Switchover for use either as thermostat or as hygrometer (2-point control) with
     effect on the actor channel and/or internal switching actuator.
      Via the parameter setting it is now possible to switch the actuator channel 5
      depending on the humidity.

** Improvement
   * Whenever connection to link partner FAL is checked, the led is blinking.
      If the wall thermostat is linked to a FAL or FALMOT, the link connection is
      checked every 50 minutes as standard. This results in a flashing LED on the
      thermostat. Especially if the connection is made via a router, this flashing could
      take longer. This should not be the case as it will cause confusion for customers.
      The LED should only be triggered when the customer makes manual changes.
   * The time information telegram does not contain a note about the summer / winter
     time change.
      So it was possible that a time request to the access point in the period where the
      changeover from summer to winter time takes place could lead to a double
      changeover.
   * Automatic switching between heating and cooling at the two-point control for
     actuator channel 5.
      Up to now, the parameter "Art der Zweipunktregelung" was used to specify whether
      the two-point control for the actuator channel 5 should heat or cool. This
      parameter has now been extended by the value heating and cooling. If this value is
      now selected, the two-point control is automatically changed to heating or
      cooling.
   * Smart RX FAL cyclic packet reduction
      To reduce the radio load, a check is made before each cyclic data telegram is sent
      to the FAL or FALMOT to determine whether it actually has to be sent. If there has
      been no change in the mode, the actual temperature, the humidity and the set
      temperature, the packet does not have to be sent every cycle.


Version 2.6.000 - 2019-09-04
--------------------------------------------------------------

** Bugfix
   * DEC Identify: Time for display illumination was wrong.
      The lighting duration of the backlight and the system button by sending the DEC
      "Identify" does not correspond to the specification.

** New Feature
   * Improvement for data communication.
      If possible the device send multicasts only to PARTNER_ALL_WIRED_DEVICES instead
      of to PARTNER_ALL_DEVICES.

** Improvement
   * Immediate evaluation of temperature change for the two-point-control.
      Temperature changes triggered by the central unit or a window contact, are
      forwarded directly to the switching actuators for the two-point-control.


Version 2.4.008 - 2019-03-07
--------------------------------------------------------------

** First release
